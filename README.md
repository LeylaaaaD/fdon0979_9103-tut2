## Part 1 : Imaging Technique Inspiration
- I want to chose the pointillism technique because I think the original artwork "San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk" is characterized by short, small strokes. By using this technique to create the image with small dots, we could capture and reproduce the subtle variations in colour and details more accurately. And the present way may be more akin to the way diamond painting presents art. And this technique also holds the potential for adding animations like colour changes or movements, making the artwork more appealing and interactive.

## Part 2 : Coding Technique Exploration
- The coding technique I'll employ is a customized circle packing algorithm. By adapting this algorithm and implementing specific rules to guarantee uniform circle size and placement within segmented color regions without overlap, I can adjust the circle size or grid gap to create different effects and efficiently arrange circles while within the color boundaries. This coding technique trying to closely emulating the pointillism and diamond painting styles if adjust the circles to the fixed sizes. And it provides a structured approach to creating some complex, visually appealing compositions.
